## Setup

1. Install Java 17 JDK.
2. Use the included Maven wrapper:
   - Windows: `./mvnw.cmd`
   - macOS/Linux: `./mvnw`
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set `OPENAI_API_KEY` - required for
   question generation and AI answer evaluation (voice input runs offline
   and doesn't need this).
4. Run the app with `./mvnw javafx:run`.
5. Run tests with `./mvnw test`.

## Quality Tools

- SonarLint should be enabled in the IDE for continuous code analysis.
- SonarCloud is configured for repository scanning on `main` and pull requests.
- Snyk is configured for vulnerability scanning on `main` and weekly schedules.

## Documentation

- README: project overview and setup instructions
- CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md: contributor expectations
- CONTRIBUTING.md: contribution process
- TASKS.md: A1 tasks and A2 vision
- Issue templates: bug report and feature request
- Wiki: this page is published on the [GitHub wiki](../../wiki) and mirrored here as `WIKI.md`

## Workflow Notes

While getting the SonarCloud and Snyk CI pipelines working (fixing auth tokens, the quality gate, and mvnw permissions), a handful of commits were pushed straight to main instead of going through an issue, feature branch, and reviewed pull request. This was a mistake made early on while we were still nailing down the required workflow. From this point on, all contributions go through: open/approve an issue -> feature branch off main -> PR referencing the issue -> review by another team member -> squash and merge. See #6.

PR #14 was opened from a personal fork instead of a branch on this repo. GitHub does not pass repository secrets (`SONAR_TOKEN`, `SONAR_PROJECT_KEY`, `SONAR_ORGANIZATION`) to workflows triggered by pull requests from forks, so the SonarCloud check failed with an "Not authorized / empty project key" error even though the code itself was fine. All team members already have push access to this repo, so branches should be pushed here directly rather than from a fork — see the updated CONTRIBUTING.md.

PR #25 was accepted by WhoWhatWhereAmI without a proper code review being completed first. Although the pull request was accepted with great quality, this did not follow our agreed review process because another team member should fully review the code before it is merged. This is identified as a workflow mistake, and future pull requests will require a proper review by another team member before being approved and merged.

PR #25 also was not merged with squash and merge, causing main branch consisting of many small commits. This also breaks our agreed review process. This is also identified as a workflow mistake for future pull requests to be aware, and use the squash and merge functionality to avoid overloading main branch. 

## Quality Tools & Vulnerability Analysis
A full scan of the project on `main` confirmed no open vulnerabilities:

## Meeting Minutes

**Cadence:** In-person every Monday after lecture; online every Thursday at 7pm.

Each entry below should record: date and format (in-person/online), who attended,
topics discussed, decisions made (especially any change to how we manage the
project - workflow, labels, review process, scope), issues/PRs referenced, and
action items for the next meeting.

**Topics discussed:** API key working. update on UI. making A2 issues. separating Fxml files (scenes) to different files<br>
**Decisions made:** Decided to make custom A2 label for A2 issues related to part 2 of the project. checked on the current UI and gave feedback on how to improve it. made a scene for each tab in the app instead of everything in one java fle.<br>
**Issues/PRs referenced:** PR #9, PR #13, PR #16, Issue #12, Issue #15, PR #22, Issue #21, PR #25<br>
**Action items:** try and finalise the AI answers evaluation and question generation. try and improve the UI and its usability and finalise its controllers for javafx.

### 13-08-2026 ()
**Attendees:**<br>
**Topics discussed:**<br>
**Decisions made:**<br>

### 10-08-2026 (In-person)
**Attendees:** Neia, Gabriel, Scott, Dandan, Kenny<br>
**Topics discussed:** Referenced PR #3 (set up PR). update on teams progress with the projects. talked to the lectuer about API key<br>
**Decisions made:** API key will take time so, AI question generation and AI answer evaluation can wait. Front-end can start without the AI components. We can use dummy data for now. <br>
**Issues/PRs referenced:** PR #3<br>
**Action items:** Work on UI, UI navigation. update documentation

### 06-08-2026 (Online)
**Attendees:** Dylan, Neia, Shenol, Gabriel, Scott, Dandan, Kenny<br>
**Topics discussed:** Whos was gonna do what in the project.<br>
**Decisions made:** made a google doc with each role written down to decide what roles to divide up between us.<br>
Kenny is PM and API setup, Scott and Neia working on front-end and user authentication, Dandan working on Data Management, Shenol chose to work on AI answer evaluation, Gabriel chose to do AI question generation, Dylan working on Code tab (Code editor, Coding questions). <br>
**Issues/PRs referenced:** none<br>
**Action items:** Git repo setup before next meeting and some progress made with assgined tasks.

### 03-08-2026 (In-person)
